## Publisher's summary

Driving through Ohio in an old Pontiac, a young girl’s parents stop suddenly
when they spot watercress growing wild in a ditch by the side of the road.
Grabbing an old paper bag and some rusty scissors, the whole family wades into
the muck to collect as much of the muddy, snail covered watercress as they
can.

At first, she’s embarrassed. Why can’t her family get food from the grocery
store? But when her mother shares a story of her family’s time in China, the
girl learns to appreciate the fresh food they foraged. Together, they make a
new memory of watercress.

Andrea Wang tells a moving autobiographical story of a child of immigrants
discovering and connecting with her heritage, illustrated by award winning
author and artist Jason Chin, working in an entirely new style, inspired by
Chinese painting techniques. An author’s note in the back shares Andrea’s
childhood experience with her parents.

## In Environmental Education

Foraging is often used in environmental education to draw attention to plants
and their usefulness to people. Picking and tasting plants is a great way to
get people to look at their surroundings in a new light and gives them another
way to interact with nature. It also encourages people to value natural
spaces. To a forager, hedgerows are more than green walls, they are sources of
fresh fruit to eat or cook with--for free! Recognizing and gathering edible
plants might be more than a relaxing past time, it can also be an important
way to put more on the dinner table without adding to the grocery bill.

This book offers a different perspective on foraging, highlighting reasons why
some might avoid or react badly to activities about picking their own food
from outside. The book's descriptive language about muck, damp, and snails
does not paint a particularly appetizing picture of the main character's
experience. How many people view any outdoor or natural space in the same
light? Then there is the fact that the girl in the story wants to fit in. She
worries about the other kids seeing her picking plants in a ditch and thinking
her family is poor. She wants to have grocery store food like the others at
her school.

Another positive about this book is that it depicts a community-specific
experience in a way which is also accessible to those who aren't part of that
community. While the book is about a Chinese family living in a mostly White
community in America, many of the themes will resonate with immigrant
communities anywhere. Kids living in cities may also see a little of
themselves in the way the girl reacts to being forced to pick plants from the
mud for dinner.

_Watercress_ is also about the ways people relate to nature and interact with
it. In the story, an outdoor experience is made negative by a desire to be
accepted by others. The main character is worried that others will think their
family interacts with nature in the wrong way. Then she learns more about her
family and why they value nature and interact with it in the way that they do.
This transforms the experience into something not entirely positive, but
deeply meaningful. As readers, we can imagine how that experience might be
taken forward and help the main character become more resilient in the face of
pressure to feel like nature and outdoor spaces are not for people like her.

## Activity ideas

**Read together before heading outside** \- Kids who are worried about getting
muddy or dirty could discuss how the characters in the story feel about wading
in the ditch with bare feet and compare that with how they might feel.

  * How do the parents and brother feel compared to the young girl? 
  * How might the young girl feel the next time they pull over to pick watercress?

**Paint raw ingredients** \- The paintings in _Watercress_ are beautiful. The
watercolour brush strokes used to give the reader a sense of the plants
without being too fussy with details. Take inspiration from the illustrations
to draw or paint other vegetables as they might look growing in the ground or
freshly picked. Experiment with shapes or sizes of brush stroke to give the
impression of the leaves of different herbs.

**Develop descriptive language to convey emotion** \- The author makes great
use of description to give you a clear idea of how the young girl feels about
gathering plants from a ditch, without needing to tell you directly. Kids
could experiment with changing the desciptive language in the story to give
the same meaning, but express different emotions. The book also vivivdly
describes the taste of the watercress in a way which conveys the characters
emotions. Kids could take inspiration from the book to describe foods they've
eaten in ways which give the reader an idea for how they were feeling.

> _I take a bite of the watercress and it bites me back with its spicy,
> peppery taste. It is delicate and slightly bitter, like Mom's memories of
> home._

**Sharing stories** \- An important moment is when the mother tells stories of
her life back in China. Kids can talk to relatives about their memories of
plants they liked to eat when they were young. Are there plants they used to
eat more that they don't have as much now? Did they ever pick leaves or
berries to eat?

**Class recipe** **book** \- Kids write and share recipes for their own
favourite ways to have vegetables. They could then refer to books on foraging
or edible plants to identify ingredients which can be collected from the wild.
An extra challenge might be to develop a new recipe from only foraged
ingredients.

  * Herbs like oregano and thyme in a pizza sauce could be foraged. 
  * Lettuce might be replaced with plants like chickweed, violets, or dandelion leaves.
  * Lemony sour flavour can be provided by wood sorrel or common sorrel.

**Give watercress a taste!** \- Watercress is a versatile plant which can be
used in the same ways a spinach, adding a peppery/radishy/bitter note to
recipies. Try it:

  * Raw with thinly-sliced apple in a honey mustard dressing
  * Steamed and tossed in soy sauce and sesame oil
  * Stir-fried with garlic and ginger
