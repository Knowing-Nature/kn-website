## Publisher's summary

Acclaimed poet Bao Phi delivers a powerful, honest glimpse into a relationship
between father and son - and between cultures, old and new. A Different Pond
is an unforgettable story about a simple event - a long-ago fishing trip. As a
young boy, Bao Phi awoke early, hours before his father's long workday began,
to fish on the shores of a small pond in Minneapolis. Unlike many other
anglers, Bao and his father fished for food, not recreation. A successful
catch meant a fed family. Between hope-filled casts, Bao's father told him
about a different pond in their homeland of Vietnam.
