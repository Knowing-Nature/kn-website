## Publisher's summary

Acclaimed activist Philippe Cousteau and renowned author Deborah Hopkinson
team up to offer a story of the powerful difference young people can make in
the world. Meet Viv, who has a new home and a new school by the sea, and
follow her as she finds her way in a new place and helps bring together a
whole community to save the sea turtles of the South Carolina coast.

## In Environmental Education

I'm sure many will relate to Viv's nervousness and feeling lost at the start
of the story. I often get a similar feeling when faced with the start of a
big, open ended project, and approaching big environmental problems can be
just as daunting. This book begins with Viv's teacher breaking down the
project into approachable steps, making this a great book for beginning a
project-based unit.

A wonderful aspect of the story is how big a role community has in tackling
the problem. Viv is briefly overwhemled when the problem is identified and it
becomes clear just how many beach houses are causing it. But we turn a page
and Viv's community comes to the rescue. The class bands together behind the
idea, breaking it down into managable parts, before they bring it to the wider
community. It is easy to focus on raising awareness or individual action, but
taking only these routes can feel ineffectual and lonely. It's energizing to
see Viv and the class inspire direct collective action from the whole
community to really solve a problem.

## Discussion ideas

**Community** \- At the start of the book Viv is feeling nervous and lost.
What other words might describe how Viv was feeling moving to a new place?
After all the work with the rest of the class and meeting people living in
town, how might Viv feel by the end of the summer? How might the other people
in town feel after all that work to help the turtles?

**What comes next?** \- The last step outlined by the teacher is to reflect on
what they did and what they might do next. Their community action was a
success! But turtles come back to nest on the same beach year after year. What
might happen to the hatchlings next year? What could the class do to keep the
momentum going?

## Activity ideas

**Moonlight paintings** \- The illustrator makes use of the special qualities
of watercolour paints to create wonderfully 'loose' pictures. The pictures of
the moon over water are particularly striking. Experiment with drier and
wetter brushwork capture the mood and texture of sand, wakes, and clouds. For
the moon and reflections off waves, leave some areas of the page completely
blank to keep the brilliant white of the page.

**Recognizing achievements** \- Sometimes recognizing the work you've done in
the past can help empower you to take on bigger problems. Think of a problem
you've overcome in the past and write how you followed the action plan the
teacher laid out. What was the problem? Did you need to find information or
resources to help come up with a solution? What actions did you take? Record
and tell the story of your achievement, and what you'd like your next step to
be.

**Support a local species** \- Viv's project is to find a problem and come up
with a plan of action. Research animals and plants in your area and see if any
of them could use support. Local conservation and environmental charities can
be a great resource for this, as many of them with either be monitoring how
species are doing or can suggest organizations which do this. For example the
UK Bumblebee Conservation Trust collects data from the public to help monitor
how bumblebees are doing around the country. Find out what species might be in
trouble in your area and come up with a plan of action to support it. You may
even be able to arrange a call between your class and a scientist so they can
ask questions directly.
