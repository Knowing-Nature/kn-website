Part 1: Discussion on a report from Learning Through Landscapes about the
results of a pilot project involving 47 UK schools and 1000+ students.

  * Learning through Landscapes: <https://www.ltl.org.uk/>
  * My School, My Planet - [full report ](https://www.ltl.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/my-school-my-planet-evaluation-report.pdf)
  * My School, My Planet - [summary report](https://www.ltl.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/my-school-my-planet-evaluation-report.pdf)

This is a report on the results of a pilot project. Most of the information in
the report is only useful future rollout of the programme, and suggests
directions for improvement and research. Not many specific insights for
practitioners.

Added caveat that this pilot was conducted in Autumn of 2020 where comparisons
with what children were doing before September are highly unusual due to the
UK national lockdown. Increase in physical activity is not surprising, as the
study was conducted while most restrictions were lifted.

## Main findings in the report

Positive impacts seen:

  * More engaged with local environmental issues
  * More engaged with their school grounds
  * More physically active 
  * Gained new knowledge about the topics studied in the project

Other results:

  * Connectedness to nature did not change much. Except in the participants least connected with nature at the start of the project. They did see an increase in their sense of connectedness.
  * Sense of social wellbeing unchanged
  * No change to overall happiness with their school. However most participants began with high happiness with their school.
  * Unclear results regarding linking identity and cultural heritage with environmental themes.

Would be good to get more details on:

  * Comparisons with control classes.
  * Frequency of sessions.
  * Content and delivery of project sessions. Were sessions topic content focused, or environmental issue focussed?

## Putting the report in context of wider environmental education research

Increase in knowledge about the subject is not surprising. Research generally
supports the idea that educational experiences kids get on field trips are
effective.

Sessions with topic specialists at zoos, aquaria, outdoor sites result in more
learning that self-guided visits. It is not be surprising to see that sessions
with educators from specialist outdoor ed providers would be more effective
than a similar session led by classroom teachers with less experience teaching
outdoors.

Many studies highlight the difficulty of altering attitudes towards nature,
intentions to take action, and behaviour. More exposure to nature is generally
more effective at achieving these outcomes. Lack of consistent results on
connectedness to nature is unexpected in a term-long project. Details on the
content and delivery of the sessions could give insight into why there were
not stronger results. Other research suggests this may be because the sessions
were too issue focused. Another possibility is that the programme was too long
or intense, and participants may have begun to suffer from assessment fatigue
or a kind of topic burnout.

Follow-up evaluation of participants would be informative about the long-term
effectiveness of environmental education interventions, for which research is
lacking. Some suggestion in prior research that a longer duration programme
like that would have durable results. Again details about the sessions would
be informative.
