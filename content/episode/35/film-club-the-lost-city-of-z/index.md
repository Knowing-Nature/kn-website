Lost City of Z (2016). Directed by James Gray. Based on the 2009 book Lost
city of Z by David Grann.

British soldier Percy Fawcett is contracted by the Royal Geographical Society
to chart a river in the Amazon. During the journey he encounters remnants and
stories of a lost city in the jungle. The experience leads him to embark on a
series of expeditions to find what he has called The Lost City of Z.

### You may want to watch the movie first and think about:

  * How is the Amazon depicted?
  * What does the movie make you think about the Amazon and the people who live there?
  * How does the movie make you feel about the Amazon and the people who live there?

## Depiction of nature

  * Amazon is a backdrop
    * Not much time spent on details of the environment.
    * Does not give much sense of the biodiversity

  * The green desert
    * Uniformly, endlessly, green
    * Yellow hue throughout gives sense of unreality
    * No animals, fruit, or flowers
    * Despite being in a rainforest, the explorers are initially unable to find any food on their own

  * Amazon as a barrier 
    * Begins as wild, impenetrable
    * Becomes less hostile on Fawcett's subsequent visits

  * England and tamed nature
    * Image of a rural idyll
    * English country garden echoes images of a Garden of Eden
    * Despite the beauty and calm of the landscape, Fawcett seems to yearn for the wildness of the Amazon

## Relationship with Nature

  * Economic resource
    * Exploration is for economic value. Faucett maps river so rubber plantations can be established

  * Challenge to be conquered
    * Fawcett wants personal glory
    * European desire to push boundaries

  * Barrier to civilization
    * Begins as a “green hell”, inhospitable to ‘civilization’
    * Over the course of the film Fawcett starts to see amazon as a home for people and, he suspects, a civilization
    * Remains of city has since been found in the Xingu river basin, now called Kuhikugu

### Relationship with amazonian peoples

  * Fawcett begins with British colonial views of Amazonian peoples’ as primitives/savages. His views are depicted as changing in subsequent expeditions
    * Impressed by their fishing techniques and their ability to cultivate the jungle
    * Argued against interference in their lives, against violence towards them
    * In reality Fawcett was more conflicted about Amazon peoples
      * Theorized that 'white indians' from Europe had crossed the Atlantic and civilized them

## Problematic points

### Rethinking what is ‘civilized/civilization’

  * Film does little to challenge the western/Eurocentric view of ‘civilization’ as tied to material culture.
    * Fawcett uses pottery as marker of civilization worthy of exploration and ‘discovery’
    * What Fawcett recognizes as cultivation of the rainforest, is monoculture plantation agriculture.

### Rethinking what is primitive

  * As fellow humans peoples of the Amazon have been on Earth just as long as anyone else, and have history just as long as any other.
  * ‘Necessity is the mother of invention’ : Change is often in response to changing needs and/or environment
  * Behavioural and physical technologies can be effective though they may not look ‘modern’

### Progression

  * Many of us are taught to think of history as progression or advancement
    * Tend to view practices and technology which appeared earlier in our history as being less advanced
  * Useful analogy is the concept of ‘living fossils’, plants and animals which appear to be largely unchanged from their fossil ancestors
    * Doesn’t mean there have been no changes
    * The physiology is just as suited to survival and reproduction today as it was for the now fossilized ancestor

### Thinking about present relationships with indigenous peoples

  * Still colonial/extractive
  * Cultural tourism can often still be colonial. Takes important practices and reduces them to an experience for personal enjoyment. Often separated from meanings, history, and significance for the people.
  * What has changed for these people to now require money from outsiders?

### The role of women

  * Does little to challenge Fawcett’s exclusion of his wife from his expeditions
  * Contemporary with Marianne North, who went on similar expeditions on her own
