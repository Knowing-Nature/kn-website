In our experience, many non-school education providers offer 45min - 1hour
sessions. In an effort to help teachers and attract bookings these are often
curriculum focused. This has meant that climate change has been an add-on to
the session, if the educator is able to fit the topic into the timeslot.
However, in the last couple years, many organizations are reevaluating and
redeveloping their programmes to incorporate climate change in a more
substantial way.

Organizations which work with schools on longer programmes seem to be better
able to approach big topics requiring systemic changes, like climate change.
The multi-lesson format allows these providers to teach key concepts,
investigate consequences, and work with students to create solutions to
problems.

It may be better for providers offering only short sessions to not worry about
directly addressing climate change in sessions which already have another
focus.Instead these sessions could emphasize developing pro-environmental
attitudes as it is this attitude which forms the basis for willingness to take
action on climate change.

**Climate anxiety**  
Climate change is a big problem with frightening consequences. It can cause
anxiety in adults and children.

  * Approach the topic in manageable chunks
  * Acknowledge studentsâ€™ feelings
  * Give students agency by identifying problems in their environment which they can tackle
  * Give students opportunities to have positive experiences in nature
