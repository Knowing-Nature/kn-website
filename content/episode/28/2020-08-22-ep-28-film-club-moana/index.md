Discussion about environmental themes in the 2016 Disney film, Moana. Directed
by Ron Clements and John Musker.

You may want to watch the film first and think about:

  * How does the movie make you feel about the ocean? How does it give you that feeling?
  * Who, if anyone, is the villain of the movie?

## **What the film did well**

**Accurate depiction of ecology and geology**

  * Employed biologist to guide animators while researching polynesian islands
  * Tamatoa - decorator crab - normally attaches things to shell as camouflage, but uses the behaviour to catch fish
  * Magical without as much exaggeration or fantasy as might be expected in an animated Disney film

**Representing different cultures and ‘ways of knowing’**

  * Localized into: Tahitian, Maori, Hawaiian
    * Languages with few remaining native speakers.
      * Translation into Hawaiian - [Hawaii public radio](https://www.hawaiipublicradio.org/post/inside-world-translating-disneys-moana#stream/0)
      * Translation into Tahitian - [pacificans.com](https://pacificans.com/what-a-tahitian-really-thinks-about-moana/)
      * Translation into te reo Maori - [te ao : Maori new](https://www.teaomaori.news/meet-translators-behind-moana-reo-maori) ; [Scoop culture New Zealand](https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU1709/S00080/a-trio-to-translate-disneys-moana-into-te-reo-maori.htm)

  * Established Oceanic story trust involving historians, storytellers, craftsmen, navigators etc. to take part in development of the script and visuals
    * [Disney Examiner article](https://disneyexaminer.com/2016/11/02/disney-animation-created-an-oceanic-story-trust-to-make-sure-that-they-got-the-culture-right-in-moana/)

  * ‘Traditional’ skills - navigation by stars, reading weather and water currents.
    * Different ways to see the world, highlights different details
    * [Apollo 13, required navigation using landmarks and relative positions](https://www.universetoday.com/62763/13-things-that-saved-apollo-13-part-6-navigating-by-earths-terminator/)

  * Ocean as connector instead of barrier
    * In Western/European views water is often a barrier to be challenged and crossed

  * Return of Heart of Tefiti as a metaphor for voyaging to new islands as something central to their culture?
    * Balances population around islands, less resource pressure

**Use of resources**

  * First introduced to problems with coconut groves and poor fishing Moana suggests measures for sustainable food production
  * Crop rotation is common practice
    * balances use of nutrients in soil
    * Pathogens which attack specific plants can build up in soil if same crop is grown year-after-year
  * Rotating fishing areas to allow populations to recover

  * Non-magical reasons why resources may be diminishing?
    * Thrived on island for centuries - soil in easily farmed areas may be depleted
    * Dependence on single crop may be allowing pathogen to spread
    * Larger population, fishing pressure might be too high

**Managing risk**

  * Father’s understandable response to tragic event early in life leads to extreme risk aversion
    * Moana never learns to sail and ends up in greater risk because she has not learned how to manage the dangers in sailing.
    * Does nothing to curb Moana's desire to explore the ocean, but deprives her of the skills needed to do so with competence

  * Ocean is very hands-off
    * Other than when responding to Maui, the Ocean does not directly intervene
    * Possibly intervenes in extreme risk - Moana being knocked out in the storm
    * Allows Moana to learn how to sail on her own rather than propelling Moana to her goals

**The magic of the Ocean**

  * Not reliant on abundance of coral reefs to create the desire to explore
  * The way characters relate to the ocean transmits the love of it
  * Even in the Land of Monsters, part of what makes the scene magical is the perspective on the ocean
  * The ocean's draw comes from the vast size, horizon, peace, danger

## **What the film missed the mark on**

**Perspective is very human-centric**

  * Presents care of the environment as being for the benefit of humans
  * Care of nature could have been for its own sake

**Focus on expansion**

  * Hesitant about whether the world can support moving to new islands forever
  * Surely there are only so many islands Maui can pull from the ocean

## **Other thoughts**

**Gaia hypothesis**

Living things depend on and interact with inorganic parts of the environment,
creating a self regulating system. This is similar to the way in which
predator-prey relationships form self-regulating systems.

Wikipedia entry - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis>

  * The ocean represents the inorganic parts of the ecosystem, nudging humans restore balance by returning the Heart
