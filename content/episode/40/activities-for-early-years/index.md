Interview with freelance educator Gini Trower about her work with afterschool
clubs and nursery groups. She shares her experience getting started as a
freelance environmental educator and talks us through a few of her favourite
activities.

## Activities

#### Building birds nests

A bird puppet collects materials to build a nest. The bird sits on the nest
and then reveals a blown egg which was hidden in the nest. Kids focus on the
materials used and details like mosses and lichens are pointed out. The group
then goes out to find materials to build nests. If you have a suitable area,
an extra challenge could be to build a nest in bushes or shrubs. This is very
difficult, but kids do gain an appreciation for what birds do with just their
beaks!

Older kids (6+) also enjoy this activity, and may want to have a turn being
the bird puppet.

#### Making compost

Kids learn about different kinds of soil and its components, focusing on dead
plants. They then make their own compost using their own compostables from
home (plants, vegetable peels). All this is put into a container and stirred
around. Show the group a particularly mouldy fruit or vegetable and point out
that even this is compostable.

The compost can then be taken home or added to a big compost heap. The group
checks back on the compost each week to see how it changes. A water bottle
with holes poked in the lid can be used as a simple watering can so kids can
water the compost heap to keep it moist. Eventually the group can use their
compost in the garden!

Alternatively kids can layer compostables and sand in a clear bottle. They can
place in a few worms and woodlice and watch as they eat the compost and mix it
together with the sand over the course of a week or two. Make sure sand or
soil is the top layer to avoid smells and flies. If you do get smells, add it
to an outdoor compost heap where reinforcement worms can more quickly eat any
food.

#### Insect homes

The group thinks about the needs of insects and considers the kinds of places
they might find shelter. The group then goes out to find good places for
insects to hide. They then carefully collect plant stems, particularly those
which are hollow such as cow parsley. These are cut into lengths, packed into
a container with moss to hold it in. These are hung up in the garden or taken
home. Some of the homes are taken down a few months later to see if anything
has moved in.

Familiarity with the site is important to know if the right plant material is
available, otherwise this can be collected elsewhere and brought in. It is
also an opportunity to teach about safety and recognizing common plants in
their area. Other plants with hollow stems: lilies, lupins, dahlias, rushes,
bamboo.

If you are hoping for solitary bees (which don't sting), put the insect homes
in a sunny spot.
