Effective science reporting should:

  1. Outline the context
    * Gets readers interested and informs them of why they should care.
    * Informs readers of relevant prior research on the topic

  2. Describe the lines of inquiry
    * Provides insight into how researchers work. 
    * Shows readers the different problems which were overcome, or the lines of questioning which were pursued

  3. Discuss the conclusions
    * Informs readers of the conclusions researchers came to.
    * Describes how researchers evaluated and interpreted the information they collected
    * Describes how the research might contribute to the world or society

  4. Highlight areas of uncertainty and directions for future research
    * Gives a sense of how confident researchers are in their results and conclusions.
    * Outlines the limits of how generalizable results may be
    * Showing that the researchers are open to changing their views based on additional information.

## Context

Locusts are insects related to grasshoppers most famous for their roles as a biblical plague eating the crops of Egypt. Since January locust swarms have been affecting a region spanning from North-western India to Kenya. High rainfall led to lots of vegetation growth and good breeding conditions for the locusts, which continue to affect the region now in September. ([Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN](http://www.fao.org/ag/locusts/en/info/info/index.html)) 

Locusts usually live mostly solitary lives, actually tending to avoid other
locusts. However they can switch to a gregarious phase where they are
attracted to other locusts, gathering together and forming large groups or
swarms. In August a group of scientists published a paper describing how they
isolated a chemical which acts as a pheromone, causing migratory locusts to
gather.

## Lines of inquiry

The Daily Mail and Business Insider both report on the researchers' work as a
complete narrative of how the pheromone affects locus behaviour.

_Business Insider_

> “But until now, scientists weren't sure what causes the insects to come
> together and abandoning their solitary lifestyles. A study published
> Wednesday in the journal Nature pinpointed the trigger:”

_The Daily Mail_

> “Both solitary and gregarious locusts – those that live in groups – are
> strongly attracted to 4VA, regardless of their age and sex. If four or five
> solitary locusts are housed together, they too begin to produce and emit the
> pheromone. This then causes swarming behaviour by attracting other locusts
> in the field, eventually building up a fearsome locust cloud.”

The problem with both of the reporting from Business Insider and The Daily
Mail is that they both focus on the results and the implications. This is
problematic because it suggests that scientists are now certain of what
happens. Future research which contradicts or complicates these results could
lead to confusion over which version of the narrative is ‘true’. This can also
undermine confidence in scientists and institutions if the public perceives
them to not be able to provide the kind of truth they have been taught to
expect.

The report from Nature walks the reader through the experiments conducted by
the researchers. Showing how each experiment led into the next as the team
built on the information they collected. Readers are brought along the journey
and can read about the evidence and how the researchers built their case.

## Results and implications

_The Daily Mail_

> “In outdoor tests on artificial turf, sticky traps baited with 4VA snared
> dozens of locusts released from the lab. The flat panels, to which an
> adhesive substance was applied, also caught locusts when deployed in a
> wetland reserve near Tianjin, eastern China.”

_Business Insider_

> “But the discovery of 4VA could facilitate a more surgical approach to
> fighting swarms: The study authors suggest deploying a synthetic version of
> the scent to lure locusts into traps where they can be killed. They tried
> this on a small scale, baiting sticky traps with 4VA. They trapped dozens of
> locusts.”

Both of these perspectives do give the reader some sense of how the
researchers know that pheromone traps can be effective. But again the focus is
on the positive result. This could give the impression that this is
straightforward or that a synthetic version already exists when it is actually
just a direction for future research. This could again undermine trust in
scientists by giving the impression that solutions to problems are being
withheld.  

Uncertainties and directions for future research

The Nature piece highlights the limits of the information they gathered in
their experiments. This primes readers to expect that additional information
will likely emerge which could change how these results are interpreted.
Readers are primed to handle this future scenario as building a more complete
picture rather than as falsification of what had been touted as truth.
