Welcome to the Knowing Nature. A podcast exploring and engaging with the
natural world.

To start we introduce ourselves and discuss experiences which influenced our
attitudes towards nature. We also discuss the importance of adults
demonstrating that it is fun and interesting to spend time in nature. Rounding
off we share some suggestions for simple things to do with kids outdoors and
the talk about the importance of imagination.

This episode’s discussion was framed by this paper:
