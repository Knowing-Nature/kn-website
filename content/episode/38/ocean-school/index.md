Interview with Lucija, Science producer at Ocean School.
<https://oceanschool.nfb.ca/>

Contact Lucija: Lucija.prelovec@dal.ca

Ocean School aims to provide learners, the next generation of ocean citizens,
with the knowledge and tools to understand our influence on the ocean and the
ocean’s influence on us. They produce educational experiences which use
powerful storytelling techniques, immersive technologies and interactive
media. Its inquiry-based approach advances critical thinking, innovation and
environmental awareness.

## Resources discussed in this podcast:

### Baywatch

An interactive experience where students explore how changes to certain
variables impact the health of eelgrass in Malpeque Bay, and therefore the
survival of other species in the habitat.

### Where's whaledo?

A virtual Right Whale into your room, built to an amazing scale… Reach out and
discover every detail of this mighty mammal in augmented reality, all the way
from its blowhole to its flukes!
