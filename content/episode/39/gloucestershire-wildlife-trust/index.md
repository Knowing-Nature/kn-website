## About Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust

  * Manages around 60 sites in Gloucestershire, including Sites of Special Scientific Interest, and some Iron Age archaeological sites.
  * Most sites are very wild and do not have a visitor centre, but are beautiful and environmentally significant sites.
  * Crickley Hill and Greystones Farm are Gateway sites, which feature more facilities like visitors centres and cafes.

## Public programmes

More details can be found on their [Learning pages. ](https://www.gloucestershirewildlifetrust.co.uk/learning)

### Minibeast Detectives/Scientists

Popular with classes of all ages and families. Particularly popular with Early
Years - KS1 (Age 3–7)

Format of the session lends itself to being informal and open, or more formal.

Individuals can participate in the session in ways which suit them.

  * Focus on collecting, sorting, or in-depth examination of a creature
  * Can be more cooperative, semi-competitive (Catch more than other groups)

Simple but effective equipment, facilitated by knowledgeable staff.

### Iron age experience

  * Bookable by schools at real Iron Age site.
  * Half or whole day experiences in reconstruction of the settlement
  * Dress up and experience life and the natural world in the Iron Age
    * Activities include: Bushcraft skills, Iron Age cookery, build the wall of a hut
    * Focus on thinking about what the landscape would have been like in the past, comparison with the landscape today, and how humans have caused those changes.
  * Much more structured than Minibeast Detective because of how busy the day is.
  * Programme is still booked in winter months, when bookings for other sessions are low.

### Restore our future

We know that single visits can be great experiences which support learning.
However these single experiences are not well linked to behaviour or attitude
changes. Regular/recurring experiences are more effective. However there are
practical and financial limitations on schools being able to visit a site
multiple times a year. To get around these limitations Gloucestershire
Wildlife Trust if piloting a programme to support schools in developing their
own green spaces and build teachers’ confidence and expertise in using those
spaces.

  * Aim is for partnerships to take place over a number of years so the wildlife trust can really support the embedding of a school culture with strong link to nature and the environment.
  * Length of partnership is important to ensure it is bedded in and not dependant on a single teacher or administrator’s enthusiasm.
