Discussion about the 2018 film The Meg, directed by Jon Turtletaub.

You may want to watch the film first and think about:

  * What does the film make you feel about the shark?
  * What human impacts on the ocean are depicted?

## What the film did well

  * Magical moments descending below the thermocline and seeing all the life and diversity.
  * Plausible design of underwater research station and vehicles.
  * Plenty of moments appreciating the size and power of megalodon sharks.

### Moments highlighting modern ecological concerns.
   * Plastic pollution
  * Persecution and hunting of sharks for their fins
  * Larger animals getting caught on fishing lines
  * Moment could have come together to become a strong theme through the film, but fade away behind the action scenes and focus on killing the shark.

### Representation
  * Very diverse crew of researchers.
  * While Suyin is great, the character is let down by needing to be rescued by Jonas in nearly every instance where she begins to be an active character.

## What the film missed the mark on

### Occasional implausible science
  * Size of the megalodons
  * Thermocline trapping warm water below a layer of cold

### Health and safety
  * Rapid ascents from extreme depths can be dangerous or deadly for divers.
  * Standing on the back of boats that suddenly lurch into movement.
  * Dive equipment seemed to frequently require opening from the outside.
  * Letting your child wander around a construction/building site is not great.

### Respect for sharks
  * Many missed opportunities to portray the megalodon as an animal and explore reasons for its behaviour. Instead the meg is depicted as a monster, constantly hungry and on the attack.
  * Researchers spend time taking selfies with the dead meg. Missed opportunity to be more thoughtful with the moment and consider what could have  been learned from a live megalodon.
  * Sharks really suffered after the Jaws films, and a lot of work has been done to try and rehabilitate their image. This film occasionally takes steps in this direction, but these are ultimately lost in the plot.
