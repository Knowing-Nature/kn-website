Interview with environmental educator Catia about her work with EcoActive.

EcoActive is a charity based in East London which runs workshops with schools
and community groups. Their work with schools is usually long-term projects
which focus on developing connections with nature or empowering students to
take action on environmental issues.

Projects usually begin with a session exploring an issue like waste or climate
change. Subsequent sessions will explore different aspects of the problem and
generate ideas for ways students can address the issue in their own lives or
in the school environment. Sessions will look at developing and implementing
an action plan, with EcoActive supporting students and the school.
