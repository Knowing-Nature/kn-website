Podcast interview with Dr. Richard Comont from the Bumblebee Conservation
Trust about the citizen science projects they are involved in. He tells us
what's involved in each scheme, including suggestions for the amount of time
and experience needed. We also discuss the benefits and limitations of citizen
science projects, and some of what can be learned from the information which
is collected. We end with discussion of the pros and cons of different ID
guides for UK bees and bumblebees (33:30).
